## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep indigo (#3F51B5) to inspire trust and stability in a financial dashboard context.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5) provides a clean, distraction-free backdrop for detailed dashboards.
- Accent color: A vivid violet (#BA68C8) provides an accessible color for focus actions such as simulated buttons or graph highlights.
- Body: 'Inter' sans-serif. Headline: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif; combination is best suited to detailed business information.
- Use a set of consistent, professional line icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Design Icons.
- Employ a grid-based layout for clear data presentation, dividing the dashboards into logical sections. Use white space to prevent visual clutter.
- Subtle transitions when loading simulated data or switching between sections to enhance user experience without being distracting.
